[![obskyr.io](README-header.png)](https://obskyr.io/)

It's [my personal website](https://obskyr.io/), showcasing my projects and such! It's a plain (though artisanal and fully custom) Jekyll site, so to build it, simply [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and run `jekyll build`, and the compiled site will await you in the `_site/` directory. Feel free to look through the source code for inspiration on how to build your own site, and don't hesitate to [talk to me](https://twitter.com/obskyr) if you've got any questions or comments!

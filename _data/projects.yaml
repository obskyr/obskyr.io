    The 1997 PC-98 adventure about death, family, and an otherworldly train. In English for the first time in over two decades. A flawed diamond, forgotten by time. With the translation comes a *Player's Companion*, which offers context on the game's development and explanations for cultural references.

    *The Nightmare of Druaga: Fushigino Dungeon*, the roguelike PS2 sequel to the classic *Tower of Druaga*, has a lot of secrets. When Arika localized it, though, they *removed the hints* for those secrets. This is a translation of all of those hints, so the game can be played in English as it was meant to be!

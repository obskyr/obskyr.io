*The Nightmare of Druaga: Fushigino Dungeon*, the roguelike PS2 sequel to the classic *Tower of Druaga*, has a lot of secrets. When Arika localized it, though, they *removed the hints* for those secrets. This is a translation of all of those hints, so the game can be played in English as it was meant to be!

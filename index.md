# *Obskyr* is Swedish for “obscure”.

ROM hacking. Japanese-to-English translation. Programming. Electronics. I'm Samuel Messner, *obskyr* online, and I do a lot of things – some of which you'll surely want to check out! But more importantly, I've got a jammin' personality, and I'm way approachable – so don't hesitate to reach out if you feel like it. My main online presence is [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/obskyr/), so head on over there!
